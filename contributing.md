## Contributing to the Programming Terms project

This project is mainly a list of markdown files.  
In order to contribute, navigate to the file you want to change.  
For now, the focus is on norwegian terms.  

When you are viewing your file of choice, click the pencil button above the file.  
This will open the editor. When you "commit" your changes, you will get a "fork" of the project in your account.
From this "fork", you can make a "pull request" of the changes so we can discuss them before they are "merged" into the main "branch".

You can get started right now by navigating to this url:

Thanks a lot for your engagement!
